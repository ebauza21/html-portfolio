<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m a 30-year-old aspiring full stack developer from sunny Florida. When I’m not diving into code, you can usually find me out surfing, hitting the golf course, or chasing down something new to learn. I’m passionate about building cool, useful things on the web—and I’m always up for a challenge!</p>
